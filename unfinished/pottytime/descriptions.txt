Pink to reddish - Have you eaten beets, blueberries or rhubarb recently? If not, you may have blood in your urine. It could be nothing. Or it could be a sign of kidney disease, tumors, urinary tract infections, prostate problems, or something else. Maybe even lead or mercury poisoning. Contact your doctor.

Blue or green. - Okay, this is different. There is a rare genetic disease that can turn your urine blue or green. Also certain bacteria can infect the urinary tract. But it is probably a food dye in something you ate. Or a medication. You will not die from it, but see your doctor if it persists.
