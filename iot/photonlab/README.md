#Photon Hand-On Workshop

This workshop will introduce you to IoT using the Particle (formerly Spark) Photon. The Particle Photon offers a suite of hardware and software tools to help you prototype, scale, and manage your IoT products. Based on Broadcomâ€™s WICED architecture (used in Nest, Amazon Dash), combined with a powerful ARM Cortex M3, the Photon offer wi-fi for everything. During this workshop you will pair the Photon with a wireless network, and then learn to control the digital and analog features, both in firmware, and from your own web application.
