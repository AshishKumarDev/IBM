I am still living with your ghost
Lonely and dreaming of the west coast
I don't want to be your downtime
I don't want to be your stupid game
#99,23,175
With my big black boots and an old suitcase
I do believe I'll find myself a new place
I don't want to be the bad guy
I don't want do your sleepwalk dance anymore
I just want to see some palm trees
I will try and shake away this disease
#196,109,159
We can live beside the ocean
Leave the fire behind
Swim out past the breakers
Watch the world die
#63,202,22
I am still dreaming of your face
Hungry and hollow for all the things you took away
I don't want to be your good time
I don't want to be your fall-back crutch anymore
#181,197,173
I'll walk right out into a brand new day
Insane and rising in my own weird way
I don't want to be the bad guy
I don't want to do your sleepwalk dance anymore
#153,112,84
I just want to feel some sunshine
I just want to find some place to be alone
#127,60,122
Yeah watch the world die
Yeah watch the world die
Yeah watch the world die
Yeah watch the world die
