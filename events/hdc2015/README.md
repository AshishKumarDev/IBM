# Heartland Developers Conference 2015

*September 9 - 11, 2015*

Workshop: [Hands-On IoT](http://www.heartlanddc.com/a3)

This workshop will introduce you to IoT using the Particle (formerly Spark) Photon. The Particle Photon offers a suite of hardware and software tools to help you prototype, scale, and manage your IoT products. Based on Broadcomâ€™s WICED architecture (used in Nest, Amazon Dash), combined with a powerful ARM Cortex M3, the Photon offer wi-fi for everything. During this workshop you will pair the Photon with a wireless network, and then learn to control the digital and analog features, both in firmware, and from your own web application.

Session: [Unlocking Your Application with WebSocket](http://www.heartlanddc.com/session-201-2)

WebSocket has been available to browsers (both mobile and desktop) for years, yet the potential remains largely untapped. In this session, get an introduction to using WebSocket in your applications. You will learn about the potential for WebSocket and real-time communication, and explore the usage of the publish/subscribe pattern over the commonplace request/response pattern. Packed with live, real-world demonstrations, IBM Developer Advocate, Kevin Hoyt, will show you how to unlock the potential latent in your applications. Other concepts that will be introduced include micro-services, container-based deployments (Docker), and the Internet of Things.

Keynote: [Welcome Makers](http://www.heartlanddc.com/session-k3)

In 1916, engineering student James Wilkins proposed spending $100 million to build a suspension bridge the world would eventually come to know as the Golden Gate Bridge.  Fast-forward 100 years, and we are rapidly throwing away our ability to innovate.  In this keynote address, join IBM Developer Adovcate, Kevin Hoyt, in taking a sneak peak at the next industrial revolution - the Internet of Things - and learn how it puts you, the developer, in the driver seat of opportunity.
