#Potty Time

The start of an application using beacons and IBM Presence Insights.  Tracks bathroom usage, and prompts for rating if you dwell in the bathrooms for a period of time.  Can also be used to rate bathroom visits for those restrooms without beacons (you just will not get prompted to rate the visit).  As I have just started with IBM, I am not sure if it has the sense of humor for this type of application.  Put on hold until I get a better feel for the company.  Unfinished work.
