# IBM

Collection of work from IBM.

#Bluemix

Content the interacts with IBM Bluemix in some way, shape, or form.  Software only.  Project using hardware that interact with Bluemix can be found in the "iot" folder.

#Events

Notes, presentations, and assorted other assets from events, conferences, meetups, or what have you.

#IoT (Internet of Things)

Projects that interact with hardware.  Sometimes local.  Sometimes Internet enabled.

#MobileFirst

Project using the MobileFirst Platform server locally.  Mobile back-end as a service (MBaaS) can be found under "bluemix".

#Pics On A Map

Example application that uses IBM Mobile Cloud Services to display a stream of user-captured images.  Images are available in a grid view, but also on a map.  Captured images are synchronized to the server along with geolocation information.  Roughly a clone of [GeoPix](http://www.tricedesigns.com/2015/03/27/geopix-a-native-ios-app-powered-by-ibm-mobilefirst-for-bluemix/) from my IBM colleague Andy Trice.

#Potty Time

The start of an application using beacons and IBM Presence Insights.  Tracks bathroom usage, and prompts for rating if you dwell in the bathrooms for a period of time.  Can also be used to rate bathroom visits for those restrooms without beacons (you just will not get prompted to rate the visit).  As I have just started with IBM, I am not sure if it has the sense of humor for this type of application.  Put on hold until I get a better feel for the company.  Unfinished work.
