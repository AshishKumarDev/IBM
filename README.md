# IBM

Collection of work from IBM.

#Crawl

Crawl various features of IBM Bluemix.

#Events

If you saw me at a conference, meetup, sales meeting, or other event, and were interested in the code that went along with my presentation or demos, you can find them here.  This also includes any slides that were used during the presentation.  Much of the work you can find without customization in other folders if you are interested in the originals (as I customize my content nearly every time I present).

#IoT Weather

A sampling of hardware devices communicating with IBM Bluemix.  Initially the theme is built around weather as temperature and humidity are easy sensors to find, use, and build, across multiple micro-controllers.  There is a Node.js server that handles providing REST services to devices.  There is a mobile application (Android initially) to view the current conditions.  There is a web page to view the current conditions.  First MCU is a Particle Photon.

#MobileFirst

This is a "hello world" boilerplate for an Android IBM MobileFirst project.  It uses a custom Java adapter using JAX-RS to present a REST interface on a Java object.  An Android Studio project is also included that talks to the Java adapter via MobileFirst server.  Event handling uses the WeakHandler library from Badoo which is a dependancy for using Handlers easily, without leaking memory.

#Pics On A Map

Example application that uses IBM Mobile Cloud Services to display a stream of user-captured images.  Images are available in a grid view, but also on a map.  Captured images are synchronized to the server along with geolocation information.  Roughly a clone of [GeoPix](http://www.tricedesigns.com/2015/03/27/geopix-a-native-ios-app-powered-by-ibm-mobilefirst-for-bluemix/) from my IBM colleague Andy Trice.

#Potty Time

The start of an application using beacons and IBM Presence Insights.  Tracks bathroom usage, and prompts for rating if you dwell in the bathrooms for a period of time.  Can also be used to rate bathroom visits for those restrooms without beacons (you just will not get prompted to rate the visit).  As I have just started with IBM, I am not sure if it has the sense of humor for this type of application.  Put on hold until I get a better feel for the company.  Unfinished work.
